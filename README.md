# Immunisation and collective knowledge in pandemia management

## Introduction

To help in times of virus crisis (eg. corona) and for social recovery after the initial crisis, this application uses [Verifiable Credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials) (VCs) to associate immunisation & health information to citizens.
We use VCs to **increase privacy** and data control by the user, compared to the equivalent centralized applications developed in other regions like China or Korea. In addition, VCs improve the **interoperability** and usage of this data **across borders in the European Union** (and with other regions with proper agreements), **without requiring a centralized repository**.

The application uses [EBSI](https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/EBSI) as a public decentralized registry to check the validity of the public identities of practitioners and other professionals and institutions that may be involved. In addition, the application can be configured to verify public identities against any other publicly accessible blockchain repository (like Alastria Red T) with compatible query interface (or even centralized systems, with the condition that they be trusted).

Most interactions among participants happen **off-chain** with high levels of privacy, scalability and flexibility. However, the citizen can provide **explicit consent** in the form of VCs to enable the application to send some specific information to the health authorities of each country.

In addition, the application can:

- Provide **information to health authorities** to make better operational decisions through higher levels of traceability of the health status of citizens, including vaccines and vaccination procedures.
- Use **color coded schemas for social interactions** to provide information to improve protection and prevention of people during an epidemic or pandemic situation. Color coding can be more sophisticated than current schemes, thanks to the use of VCs.
- Use exactly the same mechanism to deliver to the citizens other useful credentials during the post-crisis recovery of the society, for example **temporary permits** for going to work, visiting family or travelling, both inside a country and across borders.
