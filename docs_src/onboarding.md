# Onboarding

## Citizen

The user downloads the mobile application and registers.
There is **not any interaction** with any external server, all activity is local to the mobile so the privacy is preserved.
The password is entered to safeguard the data in the mobile (eg. encrypting the data).
In particular, the pair of keys are generated locally in the mobile and never leave the device.

After this process of onboarding, the citizen has stored in her mobile a self-issued credential which is not yet validated by anybody, so the trust on the included personal data is very low.
However, this data will be validated to some extent when a practitioner issues a health status credential, as shown in the following diagram.
