# Types of creentials

The system allows the issuance and verification of many types of credentials.
At the first level there are:

* **Self-issued credentials**: they are basically a *self-declaration* in a convenient digital form that can be exchanged among different parties. They are credentials issued by the citizen stating some fact about herself and her situation. They are the equivalent to the citizen using the self-diagnostics questionnaires to get advice, or to the functionality in some applications to help track quarantine and confinement.

* **Third-party credentials**: credentials issued by third parties stating a fact about the subject. For example, a certification of immunisation or a certificate from a company stating that a given employee is required for essential works at some time in some place.

The following sections describe some of the possible credentials managed by the system, but they can be added or modified as required.

# Third-party credentials

## Immunisation

A health authority or professional attests that the citizen is immunized, and so has a very low risk of getting ill again.

These *immunity certificates* could let people to leave the pandemia lockdown earlier than the rest of the population if they test positive for antibodies to the virus.
Even when the lockdown is released, some partial restrictions may be in place and these certificates could allow some people to move more freely and to more places.

## Safe conduct (as a responsible declaration)

In this context a *Safe conduct*, or *letter of transit*, is a certificate issued to a person to allow that person to move to some place with a given purpose.

Electronic equivalent of a responsible declaration issued by a company/employer to an employee to allow her to move. As an example, the official paper-based responsible declaration for Spain (from the Ministry of Health) is the following:

<table><tr><td>

</td></tr></table></br>

### The data included in the form is:

* **Employer**
    * Full name of person representative of the company
    * National ID of the representative
    * Tax ID of the employer
    * Contact data of the company/employer:
        * Postal address
        * Phone
        * Email

* **Employee**
    * Full name of employee
    * National ID of employee

* **Place, date and signature**

## Safe conduct (oficial)

Basically, the same as the previous one but issued by an official authority.
