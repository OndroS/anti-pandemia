We use VCs to increase privacy and data control by the user, compared to the equivalent centralized applications developed in other regions like China or Korea. In addition, VCs improve the interoperability and usage of this data across borders in the European Union (and with other regions with proper agreements), without requiring a centralized repository . The application uses EBSI as a public decentralized registry to check the validity of the public identities of practitioners and other professionals and institutions that may be involved. In addition, the application can be configured to verify public identities against any other publicly accessible blockchain repository with compatible query interface (or even centralized systems, with the condition that they be trusted). Most interactions among participants happen off-chain with high levels of privacy, scalability and flexibility. However, the citizen can provide explicit consent in the form of VCs to enable the application to send some specific information to the health authorities of each country. In addition, the application can: Provide information to health authorities to make better operational decisions through higher levels of traceability of the health status of citizens, including vaccines and vaccination procedures. Use color coded schemas for social interactions to provide information to improve protection and prevention of people during an epidemic or pandemic situation. Color coding can be more sophisticated than current schemes, thanks to the use of VCs. Use exactly the same mechanism to deliver to the citizens other useful credentials during the post-crisis recovery of the society, for example temporary permits for going to work, visiting family or travelling, both inside a country and across borders. Functionalities \u00b6 The application supports several functionalities: Easy onboarding of citizens. Health practitioners will issue to citizens different types of health status situation reports as special Verifiable Credentials. The credentials issued by practitioners will be based on lab tests, vaccination, diagnostics, etc. Citizens can self-attest their health status using questionnaires, in a similar way that is done now with some apps developed in some countries for coronavirus crisis management. These credentials are of a different nature, being self-issued and not fully verified by an authority, but they have proven to be of immense value in times of crisis. A simple verification with the mobile number, even if not legally binding, can be very useful in these situations. Citizens can provide consent to use personal data embedded in the credentials, including the GPS coordinates in their phones for different purposes, which can range from full tracking to explicit geo-tagging of some VC when the citizen considers it adecuate (for example for self-attestation of compliance with quarantine). Some messages can be automatically collected in a central server (there may be one per country depending on the citizen), and the aggregated information from many citizens can be used and analyzed. The information represented by these Verifiable Credentials can be used in a safe and privacy-preserving way for things like \"color coding\" citizens for their health condition regarding the infection status and places visited. These health condition credentials are temporary and should be destroyed when a new (updated) credential provides a more recent view on the situation. The citizen should be in control of the set of credentials that were issued to her, including the possibility to delete them. It is even reasonable to have the credentials automatically destroyed after the crisis has passed. To stress this short-lived characteristic, we call them Disposable Verifiable Credentials . The health condition credentials are tied to a digital identity of the issuing party. In case of practitioners this should be tied to their professional credentials. All data exchanges are accompanied by a GDPR consent encoded as Verifiable Claim so that legitimate use of the data can be proved. Health conditions can change a lot with time, so these health condition credentials will be regularly updated and timestamping will determine which is most recent. For each latest health condition credential, a QR can be generated by the citizen using a smartphone and this code can be read by another smartphone, either a practitioner, an official or other citizen. No physical contacts or pre-established relationship among parties are needed. These QRs are destroyed (as they are only digital, this means that they will not resolve any information) when a new health condition credential is created. Main system characteristics \u00b6 Integrated with EBSI (European Blockchain Services Infrastructure) and reusing the ESSIF components, where EBSI will have a global public registry of official health institutions (similar to the registry for Universities). The EBSI registry should be accessible externally by anybody in read mode, to verify the public identities of the health institutions. However, the application can be configured to work using any other blockchain network with compatible interfaces. Additionally, the application can reuse many of the components already available for the Diplomas use case in EBSI. The practitioners have public identities (as Verifiable Credentials), issued by the corresponding entities (the process may depend on the specific country), and they can be verified by anybody, when chacking the validity of a health status credential of a citizen. In an initial phase of the application, it is not strictly necessary that the citizens have an official identity issued by the government (ESSIF). For crisis management it could be enough that they self-issue a DID which is then used in the credential issued by the practitioner when performing the test or vaccination procedure to the citizen. Communication is in general P2P (app-2-app), achieving very high levels of privacy. It includes the ability to use a simple QR based system for sending/receiving VCs to enable simple phone-to-phone verification of a credential without previous relatinship among the participants. For example, when a citizen is walking in the street and an official has to verify that the citizen has the corresponding permit. The citizen can just display the QR representing the VC and the official can scan the QR and verify it. Credentials are stored in-app except practitioner credentials representing their identities, which are stored in a public registry. Stale/old data is deleted. An interactive and patient focused e-consent system will be included in order to ensure the highest consent rate possible, integrated with the health status credentials. Citizen data is only read by practitioners, not stored (equivalent of showing a piece of paper, but not copying it). The important exception being the case for government data analysis, for crisis management purposes. NOTE: This project is heavily inspired by the healthcrisis initiative, but it has been adapted to leverage ESSIF and in general the existing EBSI infrastructure and components.

The term includes doctors and other health-related staff, but it can also denote some other professionals that can issuse credentials in some circumstances, like a police officer. They can issue credentials directly, without using any intermediate computer system of an intitution. Health institutions : they can issue many types of credentials, via their computer systems. Those credentials are normally issued by employees of the institution using its computer systems, but the employees do not appear here. These employees do not have to be confused with the practitioner entity, which is a natural person that can issue credentials directly and independently from the health institution. Officials : the term refers in general to those professionals who can verify credentials presented by citizens. They can make the verification directly, in the same way that practitioners can issue credentials directly. One example is a police officer checking in the street that a citizen holds an appropriate credential signed by a practitioner. Even though the term does not imply it, any citizen can also verify any credential presented by any other citizen. In this case, the citizen is acting in the role of an official. Citizen onboarding \u00b6 We want to make onboarding as simple and fast as possible. Essentially, the onboarding process consists on the creation of the SSI identity, in the form of a DID. In this use case, we do not require that citizen identities are of the highest level according to the eIDAS classification and we can start with lower levels and escalate levels later. An example of this process is the following: The citizen generates the DID locally with her mobile device and without registering the DID in any external system (so this DID will not be anchored to any blockchain). The DID is stored in her mobile only. The citizen creates a self-attested credential including basic personal information like name, surname and phone number. The credential will be self-signed with the private key associated to the self-issued DID. This credential is also stored only in her mobile. When visiting a doctor, the doctor verifies the real identity of the citizen and then acts in the role of practitioner and creates a credential to the citizen, signed by the private key of the DID of the doctor (which is public and registered in the blockchain). The credential issued by the doctor will include the personal data that the citizen entered when creating her self-issued credential. The citizen stores the credential issued by the doctor in her mobile device. She can present the credential to any other entity, and the verifier can know that a doctor issued a statement about that citizen, including the verification of her personal data. The next paragraph describes the onboarding process. For the other interactions, see the appropiate chapters. Sequence diagram for citizen onboarding \u00b6 The user downloads the mobile application and registers. There is not any interaction with any external server, all activity is local to the mobile so privacy is preserved. The password is entered to safeguard the data in the mobile (eg. encrypting the data). The system supports the fingerprint as a substitute of the password. The pair of keys are generated locally in the mobile and never leave the device. After this process, the citizen has in her mobile a self-issued credential which is not yet validated by anybody, so the trust on the included personal data is very low. However, this data will be validated to some extent when a practitioner issues a health status credential, as shown in the following diagram.
